All exceptions/errors sent by the server will maintain a code of some sort, no matter what. These are the codes you
should expect so you can tell the user to fix it themselves!

11* - bad credentials/authorization (not allowed in)
	110 - login
	111 - check in
	112 - check out
	113 - roster
19* - misc. errors
	192 - failure to create jwt*
	193 - failure to set cookie**
	194 - could not decode JWT
	195 - not authorized
	196 - not authenticated


* Should still work, will just have to send credentials on every request (security risk).
** Same as above for JWT, will infill when used for something else.
